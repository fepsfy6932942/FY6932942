<h1>The Drag Reduction System in Formula 1</h1>

<!-- ABSTRACT -->
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<div id="Abstract_In-Text" class="text-block">
<p>
The use of DRS has had a significant impact on the style that racing is conducted in modern Formula 1. 
The system was put in place to give the following driver an advantage which aids them in making their 
way past the driver ahead. The goal of this paper is to dig into the mechanics and aerodynamics behind 
the system while also comparing the system’s performance on different cars as well as tracks. The data 
used will be coming from telemetry readings gathered by the cars when DRS was in use. The results show 
that the system gives the driver the advantage in terms of straight-line speed, although it can seem 
dangerous to be used for the corner apex. Overall, the system performs up to its goal of giving the 
following driver the advantage.

<!-- INTRODUCTION -->
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<div id="introduction_In-Text" class="text-block">
<p>
Formula 1 is the place where top level engineering meets daring driving skill. Cars are built specifically 
to be efficient and fast around a circuit for as long as possible. It is common to see races where overtakes 
are minimal, giving drivers no chance to get past the driver ahead. The most implemented way to overtake a 
driver is to get the opposing driver to make a mistake or to get on their bumper and use their slipstream to 
beat them to the corner. This slipstream effect became very minimal after the cars were updated aerodynamically 
in 2009. This made the car create a strong wake after it had driven through the air. This meant that getting 
close enough to use slipstream was a lot more dangerous than before. Cars were losing almost 50% of downforce 
when in the wake of another car.
</p>

<p>
Drivers were relying on tire degradation and pit stops for overtaking. This led to more processional races which 
became widely despised by fans. Their cries were heard by the FIA who worked tirelessly to find a solution. 
The 2010 season ended with just 547 overtakes in comparison to the season after, where overtaking numbers rose 
to 821.

<!-- HOW WINGS WORK -->
<h2>How Wings Work</h2>
<div id="How-Wings-Work_In-Text" class="text-block">
<p>
A Formula 1 car is like a plane flipped upside down. Rather than creating lift to fly, the wings generate 
downforce to push the car into the track, improving grip and cornering speed. The rear wing works by 
manipulating airflow over two elements: the main plane and the flap. When angled steeply, these surfaces 
increase pressure above and reduce pressure below, generating downforce. But downforce comes with drag—a force 
that resists forward motion and limits top speed.
</p>

<p>
The Drag Reduction System (DRS) changes the wing’s aerodynamic profile by raising the flap up to 50 mm. 
This reduces drag, decreases downforce, and increases straight-line speed by up to 15–20 km/h depending 
on track layout. However, because downforce is essential in corners, DRS is restricted to designated zones 
and cannot be used freely.

<!-- WHY DRS WAS INTRODUCED -->
<h2>Why DRS Was Introduced</h2>
<div id="Why-DRS_In-Text" class="text-block">
<p>
Before DRS, Formula 1 struggled with cars being unable to follow closely due to turbulent air produced by 
high-downforce wings. Drivers lost grip when approaching another car, making overtakes extremely difficult. 
In 2010, the average number of overtakes per race dropped so low that many fans and analysts called the racing 
“processional.” The FIA needed a mechanism that restored the slipstream effect safely without altering car 
design philosophy too drastically.
</p>

<p>
DRS was introduced in 2011 as a controlled way to reduce drag for the trailing car, giving them an incremental 
speed advantage that could convert close racing into an overtaking opportunity. While controversial, the system 
did increase overtaking frequency and helped address stagnation in on-track action.
</p>
</div>

<!-- DISCUSSION -->
<h2>Discussion</h2>
<div id="discussion_In-Text" class="text-block">
<p>
The effectiveness of DRS varies dramatically depending on the circuit. Tracks such as Monza, Baku, and 
Spa-Francorchamps—with long straights—maximize its impact. Technical circuits like Monaco or Hungaroring 
see limited benefit because straights are too short or too narrow for effective passes.
</p>

<p>
Telemetry data indicates that DRS typically provides a 12–20 km/h top-speed increase, but this depends on 
rear-wing angle, car philosophy, and engine mode. The downside is predictability—many fans argue overtakes 
produced via DRS are “too easy,” reducing the skill required. On the other hand, drivers note that without DRS, 
modern downforce levels would again make overtaking nearly impossible.
</p>
</div>

<!-- CONCLUSION -->
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<div id="conclusion_In-Text" class="text-block">
<p>
DRS fundamentally reshaped modern Formula 1 by re-enabling overtaking in an era defined by aerodynamic 
sensitivity. While not perfect, and sometimes producing overtakes that appear artificial, it successfully 
addresses the core problem of turbulent air preventing wheel-to-wheel racing. As regulations evolve toward 
ground-effect cars that allow closer following, DRS may eventually be phased out. For now, it remains one of 
the most influential innovations of the hybrid era.
